These are some notes on how I have configured my Iterm2. 

![iTerm]({{ "/assets/img/iTerm-setup.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  

NB: I use zch instead of bash.

# Install iTerm2  
Download and install it.  

Create a new profile.
`Command O` will open the iTerm profiles window. Click `edit profiles` and create a new one, i.e. 'Development'.

# Silence the Bell

In the `Terminal` tab, under **notifications**. Check `Silence Bell`.

# Set the Theme  

In the `Colors` tab, click **color presets**. Select `Solarized Dark`. If that option is not available, then you will need to install it first.

# Set Font

Set font size 14pt  
Set font type as `Source Code Pro`. If the font is not available, you will need to install it.
