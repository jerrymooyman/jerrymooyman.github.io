I've been a vim user for years. I keep trying different editors, but I always seem to make them behave like vim. So, invariably, I return to vim and wonder why I even left.  

.vimrc contains many setting/options and because it could be a which between having to tweak these settings, I usually find myself having to get reaquainted with them.

Here is a speel on my vim settings for quick reference.
