## Style Rules

```
    selectorlist { property: value; [more property:value; pairs] }
   
    ...where selectorlist is: selector[:pseudo-class] [::pseudo-element] [, more selectorlists]
    
    See selector, pseudo-element, pseudo-class lists below.
```

### Browser default Styles

Each browser has its own built-in style. This is why the same web page may have a different look when viewed on Chrome, Safari, IE, etc.

These default styles may be overridded, if you want a different style to the default browser styles.

normalize.css is a project that does just this. It provides a stylesheet with with default override to make the look and feel of a webpage a consistent as possible across the various browsers.

* [Firefox](http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/html.css)

### CSS Selectors

[Beginner Concepts: How CSS Selectors Work](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/)  

### The Box Model

* margin - spacing between an element and other elements
* border - the border around an element
* padding - the spacing between an elements content and the border
* content - the content of an element

The size of an element is the total sum of the border, padding and content components.
This means, when you change the size of the content, the overall size of the box also changes accordingly.

Using the following style, we can

``` css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Code, Test, Refine

1. look for natural boxes
2. look for repeated styles and semantic elements
3. write you html
4. apply styles (biggest to smallest)
5. fix things

### Verifying HTML and CSS

While html and css may be interpreted fine in one browser, if it doesn't comply to the specification, then there is no guarentee that it will be interpreted correctly in other browsers.

## Responsive Web Pages

_Responsive_ means that the page will resize depending on the screen resolution
_Adaptive_ means that the page will alter its layout to make it easier to use your thumb instead of a mouse.

### Framework

A responsive framework requires

* row with 100% page width
* colums from 1/12 to 12/12

use flex-box on rows to layout columns on the same row.

### Negative Space

Negative space is used to create some separation between elements. Its space that does not contain anything.

To create negative space we use margins and padding.

* use padding to create space between the element border and its content (inside the box)
* use margin to create space between other elements (outside the box)

### Overflow

Use overflow when you have some text that takes up more than the space available. It will create a scroll bar to keep things contained and tidy.

``` css
.some-text {
    overflow: auto;
}
```

### Tuning the Page

When laying out a page, it is beneficial to use placeholder images in leiu of the actual images.

Use sites to place temporary images into your page to help your layout take shape.

* placehold.it/[width]x[height]
* placepuppy.it/[width]/[height]
* placekitten.com/[width]/[height]

### Fonts

Use sites like google fonts to find fonts that match a give design.
Simply, 

* select a font and create a collection
* paste the font family reference provide into your page header
* paste the font family css directive into you style sheet
