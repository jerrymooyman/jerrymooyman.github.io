Here are some notes about getting setup with Heroku and deploying your node application.  
This example features deploying a node application with Webpack as the application bundler.    

### Setup Heroku toolbelt 
Download and install. This step is only required to be done once.

### Login to account
Ensure that you are in the root of your project's git repository. You will be required to provide username and password.  

```
$ heroku login
```

### Deploy the app
_create a heroku app._ Give the app a name.  

```
$ heroku create <app_name>  
```

_deploy the code._ This is done by pushing the code to the heroku branch.  

```
$ git push heroku master
```

_open the app in a browser._ Here's a handy shortcut  

```
$ heroku open
```

## Get heroku to bundle our app using Webpack
So the above steps was to create and deploy a node app. In many cases, the front end requires additional bundling.  
In this example, we will be configuring heroku to execute a bundle using Webpack.  

>It is important to know that any dependencies in your package.json file that are required by heroku must reside in the 'dependencies' section. Any packages in the 'devDependencies' section will be ignored by heroku.  

To trigger heroku to build our bundle, we need to add a postinstall script to our package.json. postinstall will be triggered after all the Node modules have been installed. To cater for running the app via webpack-dev-server and heroku, we need to add a custom webpack config for heroku.   

```javascript
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "webpack --config ./webpack-heroku.config.js --progress --colors",
        "start": "node server.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
    }
```

That should be everything you need.
