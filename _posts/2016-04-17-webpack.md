![Webpack]({{ "/assets/img/webpack.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})  

Previously, I've been using gulp and browserify in my build chain for front-end development.  
Since moving to Reactjs, I've decided to try my hand at Webpack. I've heard a lot of positive things about it in the community. So, I wanted to know what I was missing out on.  
<!--more-->

First step I took was to take a PluralSight course on the topic.  
[Webpack Fundamentals by Joe Eames](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/webpack-fundamentals). It was a very good introduction. The next step was to start using it in anger.

# Bacis CLI Commands
create a bundle with app.js as entry point

``` shell
> webpack app.js  
```

search current directory for a webpack.config file

``` shell
> webpack
```

run webpack with the specified config file

``` shell
> webpack --config myconfigfile.config
```

watch files for changes and reload app automatically

``` shell
> webpack --watch
```

run webpack with the specified config file

``` shell
    webpack --config myconfigfile.config
```

run webpack with the specified config file

``` shell
    webpack --config myconfigfile.config
```

build a production bundle

``` shell
    webpack -p
```

build source map files

``` shell
    webpack -d
```

# Webpack Dev Server

build and run an application in a local web server at localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server and localhost:8080.

``` shell
    webpack-dev-server
```

like above, but allow localhost:8080 with auto reload on file changes

``` shell
    webpack-dev-server --inline
```

serve from specified directory as root

``` shell
    webpack-dev-server --content-base '/app'  
```


# Preloaders
Preloaders are configured in the module.preloaders section as an array.  

```javascript
1    preloaders: {
2            test: /\.js$/,  
3            exclude: /node_modules/,        
3            loader: 'jshint'  
4        }
```

Line 2 regex to send files through to the loader  
Line 3 regex to exclude files from the loader  
Line 4 the loader  

## Useful preloaders
  * jshint-loader

# Loaders
Loaders are configured in the module.loaders section as an array.  

```javascript
1    loaders: {
2        test: /\.es6$/,
3        exclude: /node_modules/, 
4        loader: 'babel-loader'
4        }
```

## Useful loaders
  * babel-loader
  * strip-loader

## Babel (transpiler)
  * babel-core
  * babel-loader
  * babel-preset-es2015

## Strip-Loader
```javascript
1    var WebpackStrip = require('strip-loader');
2    var devConfig = require('./webpack.config');
3    var stripLoader = {
4        test: [/\.js$/, /\.es6$/],
5        exclude: /node_modules/,
6        loader: WebpackStrip.loader('console.log')
6    }
6    devConfig.module.loaders.push(stripLoader);
7    module.exports = devConfig;
```

# Sample webpack.config

```javascript
1     var path = require('path');
2     module.exports = {
3         context: path.resolve('js'), 
4         entry: ['file1.js', 'file2.js'], 
5         output: {
6             path: path.resolve('build/js'), 
6             publicPath: '/public/assets/js/', 
7             filename: "bundle.js"
8         },
10
11        watch: true,
12
13        devServer: {
14            contentBase: 'public'
15        },
16
17        module: {
18            loaders: [
19                {
20                    test: /\.es6$/, 
21                    exclude: /node_modules/, 
22                    loader: 'babel-loader' 
23                }
24            ]
25        }
26    }
27    extensions: ['', 'js', 'es6'] 
```

Line 3 tells webpack to look for entry files in the 'js' directory  
Line 4 tells webpack to start bundling from these files  
Line 5 tells webpack to put the bundle.js file in the build/js directory  
Line 6 tells webpack that bundle.js will be served from this directory  
Line 20 regex to send files through to the loader  
Line 21 regex to exclude files from the loader  
Line 22 the loader  
Line 27 override default file behaviour and specify which file types webpack should pickup
